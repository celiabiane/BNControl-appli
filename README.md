Application of Boolean networks control algorithms to cancer models

These notebooks show applications of the functions in BNControl-Lib to models of breast and bladder cancer.

The application to Breast cancer is published and analyzed in :
Célia Biane, Franck Delaplace. Abduction Based Drug Target Discovery Using Boolean Control Network. CMSB 2017: 57-73

The application to Bladder cancer  and comparison with patients data is presented and analyzed in (in french, PhD thesis)
Célia Biane. Reprogrammation comportementale: modèles, algorithmes et application aux maladies complexes. (Behavioral reprogramming : models, algorithms and application to complex diseases). University of Paris-Saclay, France, 2018

The model of Bladder cancer and the data come from :
